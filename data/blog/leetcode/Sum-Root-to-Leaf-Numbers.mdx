summary: You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only. Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number. For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123. Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer. A leaf node is a node with no children.

## Problem Statement
[LeetCode Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/description/)

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
    // Initialize a variable to store the sum
    int ans = 0;
    // Call the depth-first search function to compute the sum
    dfs(root, 0, ans);
    // Return the computed sum
    return ans;
  }

private:
  void dfs(TreeNode* root, int path, int& ans) {
    // If the current node is null, return and do nothing
    if (root == nullptr)
      return;
    // If the current node is a leaf node
    if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr) {
      // Compute the sum and update the answer
      ans += path * 10 + root->val;
      // Return as we don't need to explore further
      return;
    }

    // Recursively call dfs for the left child with updated path and ans
    dfs(root->left, path * 10 + root->val, ans);
    // Recursively call dfs for the right child with updated path and ans
    dfs(root->right, path * 10 + root->val, ans);
  }
};
```

### Algorithm steps:
1. Start with the root node of the tree.
2. Initialize a variable `ans` to store the sum.
3. Call the depth-first search function (`dfs`) with the root node, initial path value 0, and `ans`.
4. In the `dfs` function:
   - Check if the current node is null. If so, return.
   - If the current node is a leaf node, compute the sum of the path so far and update `ans`.
   - Recursively call `dfs` for the left child with an updated path and `ans`.
   - Recursively call `dfs` for the right child with an updated path and `ans`.
5. Return the final `ans` after the `dfs` function completes.

### Time complexity:
- The time complexity of this code is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.

### Space complexity:
- The space complexity is also `O(n)` in the worst case. This is because of the recursion stack, which can go as deep as the height of the tree.

To reduce complexity, we can avoid passing the `ans` variable by reference and instead return the sum from the `dfs` function. Here's the modified code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
    // Call the depth-first search function to compute the sum
    return dfs(root, 0);
  }

private:
  int dfs(TreeNode* root, int path) {
    // If the current node is null, return 0
    if (root == nullptr)
      return 0;
    // If the current node is a leaf node, return the computed sum
    if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr)
      return path * 10 + root->val;

    // Recursively call dfs for the left child and right child
    return dfs(root->left, path * 10 + root->val) + dfs(root->right, path * 10 + root->val);
  }
};
```

The time complexity and space complexity of this modified code remain the same, `O(n)`.
