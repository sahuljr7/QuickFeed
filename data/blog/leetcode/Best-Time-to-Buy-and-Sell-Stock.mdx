## Problem Statement
[LeetCode Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
    // If k is greater than or equal to half the size of prices vector
    if (k >= prices.size() / 2) {
      // Initialize variables for selling and holding
      int sell = 0;
      int hold = INT_MIN;

      // Iterate through each price
      for (const int price : prices) {
        // Update sell with the maximum value between current sell and hold + price
        sell = max(sell, hold + price);
        // Update hold with the maximum value between current hold and sell - price
        hold = max(hold, sell - price);
      }

      // Return the final sell value
      return sell;
    }

    // If k is less than half the size of prices vector
    // Initialize vectors to store sell and hold values for each transaction count
    vector<int> sell(k + 1);
    vector<int> hold(k + 1, INT_MIN);

    // Iterate through each price
    for (const int price : prices)
      // Iterate from k to 1 to update sell and hold values
      for (int i = k; i > 0; --i) {
        // Update sell[i] with the maximum value between current sell[i] and hold[i] + price
        sell[i] = max(sell[i], hold[i] + price);
        // Update hold[i] with the maximum value between current hold[i] and sell[i-1] - price
        hold[i] = max(hold[i], sell[i - 1] - price);
      }

    // Return the maximum profit for k transactions
    return sell[k];
  }
};
```

### Algorithm steps:
1. If the value of k is greater than or equal to half the size of the prices vector, it means we can make transactions as many times as we want. In this case, we use a simpler approach to calculate the maximum profit.
   - Initialize `sell` to store the maximum profit we can achieve by selling, and `hold` to store the maximum profit we can achieve by holding a stock.
   - Iterate through each price:
     - Update `sell` with the maximum value between the current `sell` and `hold + price`.
     - Update `hold` with the maximum value between the current `hold` and `sell - price`.
   - Return the final `sell` value.

2. If k is less than half the size of the prices vector, meaning we have a restriction on the number of transactions we can make, we use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum profit.
   - Initialize vectors `sell` and `hold` to store the maximum profit for each transaction count.
   - Iterate through each price and each possible transaction count from k down to 1:
     - Update `sell[i]` with the maximum value between the current `sell[i]` and `hold[i] + price`.
     - Update `hold[i]` with the maximum value between the current `hold[i]` and `sell[i - 1] - price`.
   - Return the maximum profit for k transactions, which is stored in `sell[k]`.

### Time complexity:
- The time complexity of this code is O(n * k), where n is the size of the prices vector and k is the given value. This is because we have two nested loops iterating over the prices vector and a range of transactions.

### Space complexity:
- The space complexity of this code is O(k), as we are using two vectors of size k to store the sell and hold values.

Complexity cannot be significantly reduced in this case, as we need to consider each transaction and each price to compute the maximum profit.
