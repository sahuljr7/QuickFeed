## Problem Statement
[LeetCode Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
    const int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> ans(n);        // Can also use `nums` as the ans array.
    vector<int> prefix(n, 1);  // prefix product
    vector<int> suffix(n, 1);  // suffix product

    // Calculate prefix products
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
      prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];

    // Calculate suffix products
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i)
      suffix[i] = suffix[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];

    // Calculate the final product except self
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      ans[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i];

    // Return the result
    return ans;
  }
};
```

### Algorithm steps:
1. Create three vectors:
   - `ans`: This will store the final result.
   - `prefix`: This will store the prefix products.
   - `suffix`: This will store the suffix products.
2. Initialize the size of the vectors as `n`, the size of the input `nums`.
3. Calculate the prefix products by iterating through `nums` from the second element to the last. Store the product of all previous elements in `prefix[i]`.
4. Calculate the suffix products by iterating through `nums` from the second-to-last element to the first. Store the product of all following elements in `suffix[i]`.
5. Multiply the corresponding elements of `prefix` and `suffix` to get the product of all elements except `nums[i]`, and store the result in `ans`.
6. Return the `ans` vector.

### Time complexity:
- The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the size of the input `nums`. This is because we iterate through the `nums` vector three times, and each iteration takes linear time.

### Space complexity:
- The space complexity of this code is O(n). We use additional space to store `prefix`, `suffix`, and `ans`, each of size `n`.

This code efficiently computes the product of all elements except self for each element in the input vector `nums`. There's no significant reduction possible for time or space complexity in this scenario because we need to compute prefix and suffix products to achieve the desired result.
