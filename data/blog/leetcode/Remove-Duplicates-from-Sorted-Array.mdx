summary: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

## Problem Statement
[LeetCode Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Initialize a variable i to keep track of the position to overwrite in nums
    int i = 0;

    // Iterate through each element num in nums
    for (const int num : nums)
      // Check if either i is less than 1 (meaning first element) or num is greater than the previous element
      if (i < 1 || num > nums[i - 1])
        // If the condition is true, update the current element in nums and increment i
        nums[i++] = num;

    // Return the length of the modified nums array
    return i;
  }
};
```

### Algorithm steps:
1. Start with an index `i` set to 0.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the given array `nums`.
3. Check if `i` is less than 1 (indicating the first element) or if the current element `num` is greater than the previous element in `nums`.
4. If the condition is true, update the element at index `i` in `nums` with the current element `num` and increment `i`.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all elements in `nums`.
6. Return the value of `i`, which represents the length of the modified `nums` array without duplicates.

### Time complexity:
- The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we iterate through each element of `nums` once.

### Space complexity:
- The space complexity of this code is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input array `nums`.

To reduce complexity, we can simplify the code by directly using the `std::unique` function from the `<algorithm>` header in C++. Here's the modified code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Use the std::unique function to remove duplicates
    nums.erase(std::unique(nums.begin(), nums.end()), nums.end());
    // Return the new length of the modified nums array
    return nums.size();
  }
};
```

The time complexity of the modified code remains O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`, because `std::unique` has linear time complexity. However, the space complexity is O(1) because `std::unique` modifies the array in place without using any additional space.
