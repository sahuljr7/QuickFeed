## Problem Statement
[LeetCode Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks/description/)

You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the score of the ith athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique. Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the rank of the ith athlete.

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  // Function to find relative ranks
  vector<string> findRelativeRanks(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Getting the size of input array
    const int n = nums.size();
    // Creating a vector to store the result
    vector<string> ans(n);
    // Creating a vector to store indices
    vector<int> indices(n);

    // Filling indices vector with consecutive values starting from 0
    iota(indices.begin(), indices.end(), 0);

    // Sorting indices vector based on the values of nums in descending order
    ranges::sort(indices,
                 [&](const int a, const int b) { return nums[a] > nums[b]; });

    // Iterating over the sorted indices
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      // Assigning medals or ranks based on the index position
      if (i == 0)
        ans[indices[0]] = "Gold Medal";
      else if (i == 1)
        ans[indices[1]] = "Silver Medal";
      else if (i == 2)
        ans[indices[2]] = "Bronze Medal";
      else
        ans[indices[i]] = to_string(i + 1);

    // Returning the result vector
    return ans;
  }
};
```

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Initialize variables: `n` as the size of the input vector `nums`, `ans` as an empty vector of strings to store results, and `indices` as a vector of integers to store indices.
2. Populate `indices` with consecutive values starting from 0 using `iota`.
3. Sort `indices` based on the values of `nums` in descending order.
4. Iterate over `indices`:
   - If the index `i` is 0, assign "Gold Medal" to the corresponding index in `ans`.
   - If `i` is 1, assign "Silver Medal".
   - If `i` is 2, assign "Bronze Medal".
   - Otherwise, assign the rank converted to string (i+1) to the corresponding index in `ans`.
5. Return the `ans` vector.

### Time Complexity: 

O(n log n) - due to the sorting operation.

### Space Complexity: 

O(n) - additional space is used for storing the `ans` and `indices` vectors.
