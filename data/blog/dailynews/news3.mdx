# What is Google Gemini?

Google first introduced its AI endeavor as Bard in March 2023 in a free and experimental capacity. The chatbot was originally run on the LaMDA large language model (LLM).

In August 2023, it introduced Google Duet as an enterprise option featuring AI-inundated Workspace apps, including Gmail, Drive, Slides, Docs, and others.

However, in December 2023, Google upgraded the Bard language model to the Gemini LLM. By February it unified Duet and Bard into a single product and rebranded all of its AI options under a single name, Gemini.

Like ChatGPT, Google Gemini is an AI chatbot that can generate text and answer questions, and it can do just about anything that ChatGPT can do.

Google is marketing its Gemini generative AI as especially powerful due to its multimodal capabilities that allow it to perform tasks such as generating text, images, video, audio, and code within the same platform. Gemini supports several large language model (LLM) options that are available for different tiers of purpose and expertise, including Gemini Nano, Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra, and Gemini Advanced.

Google has big aspirations to make its AI useful in a host of applications. It is currently testing Gemini integration into its Chrome browser. It was also previously integrated into Google’s Workspace apps, including Gmail, Drive, Slides, Docs, and others at an enterprise level. However, the Gemini AI chatbot on its own remains free at its most basic level and easy to access. All you need to do is sign into or register for a free Google account.

Google has recently introduced a paid tier called Google One AI Premium, which is available to all users and includes several perks, in addition to its Gemini chatbot run by the latest and most powerful LLM version. Read on to learn about how to get started with Google Gemini and which Gemini option might be right for you.

# How to sign up for Google Gemini?

Signing up is simple if you’re looking to use the free version of Google Gemini. Many people already have a Google account and email. You simply use your Google credentials to access the Gemini site and you’re all set. If you need to, you can sign up for a Google account before you proceed.

You may see some terms and services notifications, which you can read through and confirm at your discretion. Then there may be a notice that Google Bard is now Google Gemini. After that, you will see a page that resembles most typical AI chatbot setups. It includes a personalized introduction with your name, some prompt suggestions, and a prompt text box at the bottom.

In the upper-left corner is a Gemini drop-down menu where you can refresh your page to a new chat or select the option to upgrade to the Gemini Advanced paid tier. In the furthest left corner is a three-line icon that lets you expand the menu. Here you can see a new chat tab, your recent prompts, a help option, activity options, settings, and another option to upgrade to Gemini Advanced. Select the three-line icon again to collapse the menu.

You can see your Google account icon in the upper-right corner. Select it to see your Google account details and any other connected accounts.
