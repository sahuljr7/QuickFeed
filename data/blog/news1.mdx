summary: In 2024, the once-revered GPU, hailed as the industry's pinnacle, faced a sobering litmus test and faltered. Its decline marks a significant shift in the tech landscape. With its popularity waning, questions arise about its relevance in the rapidly evolving world of graphics processing. This failure prompts reflection on the factors contributing to its downfall and raises anticipation for what new innovations will emerge to fill the void.

Nvidia’s RTX 3060 is the most popular GPU around, and it’s not even close. According to the latest Steam hardware survey, the 2021 GPU is in close to 7% of gaming PCs. That’s a huge slice of the pie. For reference, the second most popular GPU, the RTX 2060, sits at just under 4%. It’s easy to see why the GPU is popular, too. You can pick it up for between $250 and $300 — and for even less used — and it comes with a critical 12GB of VRAM.

It’s the go-to GPU for maxed-out 1080p gaming in 2024, but based on my testing, it probably shouldn’t be. The RTX 3060 is a workhorse, and for a large range of games, it’s one of the best graphics cards you can buy. When it comes to the latest, most demanding games, however, the RTX 3060 struggles to keep up.
